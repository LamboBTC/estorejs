#Estore

###About

Run an e-store in the cloud using mongodb, keystone and nunjucks.

E-Store is designed to be a cloud supported [12 factor](http://12factor.net) type application for running an
e-commerce website.

###Running

Estore is not considered safe for production yet so deploy at your own risk. It comes with a default template that
is enough to show the concept of Estore.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run npm install.
3. Configure your .env file.
4. Run npm start.

We are using [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) on the backend, consult the documentation there for usage until we
put up more info.

Have fun!
